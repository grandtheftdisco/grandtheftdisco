### [🍞 Toasty - Windows System Tray App](https://github.com/grandtheftdisco/toasty)
**Powershell-based notification filtering for deep work**
- I got tired of missing _'want anything for lunch?'_ texts because I was heads-down with my phone on silent in my desk drawer
- The Windows Phone Link desktop app seemed like a good fix, but it doesn't allow for content- or sender-based filtering
- That was no different than having my phone on my desk: too disruptive!
- So, I decided to build my own filter system ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
- I plan to iterate on this project down the road by building a WiFi-enabled notification device with Toasty's filters
- _full project details coming soon!_

## Why I'm Different

**Backend-First Mindset**: While many developers gravitate toward frontend work, I get excited about database design, API architecture, and solving complex server-side problems.

**Relentless Problem Solver**: I don't just write code - I architect solutions. When something breaks, I dig until I understand the root cause and fix it properly.

**Rapid Growth**: 1 year ago, I started learning web development. Today I'm shipping production applications with complex payment integrations and admin dashboards.

**Real-World Experience**: I've worked directly with business stakeholders, handled real customer requirements, and built systems that actually process payments and manage orders.

## When I'm Not Coding
- **Knitting** - Because debugging code and picking up dropped stitches require similar patience
- **Chicken Farming** - Battle-testing [Henventory](https://github.com/grandtheftdisco/henventory) day after day!
