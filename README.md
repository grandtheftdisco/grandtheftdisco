## 👋 Hi, I’m Amanda: webdev noob, embedded dev dilettante.

Welcome to my GitHub! I've been learning software development since July 2025, and made the foray into webdev around October 2025.
- My goal is to work full-stack, but I've been leaning towards the back-end.
- I have been focusing on Ruby on Rails, and am considering learning Laravel to really solidfy my understanding of MVC.
- I have not pledged allegiance to vim/nvim, but I've been learning the ropes.
- If and when I've got free time, I am either knitting or tinkering with my Arduino Uno kit
