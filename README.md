❗If you're here for my portfolio: please note I've got a few repos to make public in the days ahead. Just need to write some READMEs!

- 👋 hi, I’m Amanda -- webdev noob, embedded dev dilettante.
- vanilla js | vanilla html/css | ruby | C 
- currently learning rails
- say hi! -- grandtheftdisco@gmail.com
- when not coding, am knitting

<!---
grandtheftdisco/grandtheftdisco is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
